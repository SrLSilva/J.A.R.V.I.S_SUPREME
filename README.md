# JARVIS.SUPREME.HTML.CSS.JV.
Hi.
This is Jarvis Assistant Supreme, I created it to help me in the pandemic days. I was tired of searching the sites i wanted to go so i decided to use my young programming skills to develop a simple assistant made just with html. Well, it was a year ago. Now I created a html.css.jv. assistant, still simple, but way much better. I used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API"> Web Speech API</a> to command with just click and a voice command. I don't now how to create a localhost server so the assistant will be asking every time for the permission to use the mic. I hope you guys improve and enjoy it.
Here's the list of sites and how to go to them:

-Classroom- say "open classroom";
-Youtube- say "open YouTube";
-Alura- say "open Alura";
-Scratch- say "open Scratch";
-P5js- say "open p-j"
-GitHub- say "open my repository";
-Whatsapp- say "open Whatsapp";
-Facebook- say "open Facebook";
-Instagram- say "open Instagram";
-Twitter- say "open Twitter";
-Twich- say "open Twich";
-Reddit- say "open happiness";
-TikTok- say "open that again"; (no kidding)
-Topflix- say  "open Topflix";
-Netflix- say "open Netflix";
-Amazon- say "open Amazon";
-Discord- say "open discord";
-Gmail- say "pen Gmail";
--Say Let's go-- (just say).
